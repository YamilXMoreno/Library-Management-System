# Library Management System in Java and Swing with a SQL Database Integration 

The Library Management System developed in Java with Swing for the GUI is a comprehensive 
solution designed to streamline the operations of libraries, ensuring efficient management 
of books, patrons, and transactions. It offers librarians and administrators a user-friendly 
interface to handle tasks such as book cataloging, patron registration, lending, and reporting.

# Key Features

**Book Cataloging:** Librarians can easily add, update, or remove books from the library catalog. 
Each book entry includes details such as title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability status.

**Patron Management:** The system allows librarians to register new patrons, update their 
information, and manage their borrowing privileges. Patrons can be categorized based on membership 
type or status.

**Check-in/Check-out:** Patrons can borrow and return books using a simple check-in/check-out 
process. The system automatically updates the book's availability status and maintains a 
transaction history for each patron.

**Search and Filter:** Users can search for books or patrons using various criteria 
such as title, author, ISBN, or patron ID. Advanced filtering options enable quick access 
to specific items or user records.

**Fine Calculation:** The system calculates fines for overdue books based on predefined
rules and generates alerts for patrons with outstanding fines. Librarians can manage fine
payments and waive fees if necessary.

**User Authentication:** The system implements user authentication to ensure that only authorized
personnel can access sensitive features such as book management or patron records.

# Technical Implementation

**Language:** Developed using Java programming language, leveraging its platform
independence and object-oriented features.

**GUI Framework:** Utilizes Swing framework for building the graphical user 
interface, providing a consistent and responsive user experience across different platforms.

**Database Integration:** Integrates with a relational database management system in SQL to store 
and retrieve library data efficiently.

**Data Modeling:** Utilizes object-relational mapping (ORM) techniques to 
map Java objects to database tables and streamline data access operations.

**Multithreading:** Implements multithreading to handle concurrent user interactions and background 
tasks, ensuring smooth performance even under heavy usage.
